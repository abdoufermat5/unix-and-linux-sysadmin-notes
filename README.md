## POV

This repository is a collection of notes from the book *Unix and Linux system administration handbook by Evi Nemeth Garth Snyder Trent R. Hein Ben Whaley Dan Mackin*. I am reading the 5th edition of the book. This shit is a comprehensive guide to Unix and Linux system administration. 

## Path to the notes

The notes are organized in chapters. Each chapter has a `readme.md` file that contains the notes for that chapter. The notes are organized in a way that makes it easy to follow the book. I am not following the chapters in order. I am reading the book in a way that makes sense to me.

## Why I am reading this book

I am reading this book to learn more about Unix and Linux system administration. I am a software engineer and I have been working with Linux for a while. I want to learn more about the operating system and how to manage it. I am also interested in learning more about system administration in general. I am reading this book to get a better understanding of the topic. 

My GOAL is to be the **ULTIMATE Software Engineer**.
