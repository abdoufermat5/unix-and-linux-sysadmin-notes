# Chapter 1: Where to start

## Table of most popular linux distributions

![table](./data/table-of-linux-distros.png)

The most viable distributions are not necessarily the most corporate. For example, we expect Debian GNU/Linux to remain viable for a long time despite the fact that Debian is not a company, doesn’t sell anything, and offers no enterprise-level support. Debian benefits from a committed group of contributors and from the enormous popularity of the Ubuntu distribution, which is based on it.

## Example of a Linux distribution

> Debian (pronounced *deb-ian*, named after Debra and Ian Murdock) is one of the oldest and most well-regarded distributions. It is a noncommercial project with more than a thousand contributors worldwide. Debian maintains an ideological commitment to community development and open access, so there’s never any question about which parts of the distribution are free or redistributable.

Debian defines three release that are maintained simultaneously:

- stable: targeting the production servers,
- unstable: with current packages that may have bugs and security vulnerabilities,
- testing: a mix of stable and unstable.


> Ubuntu: is based on Debian and maintains Debian's commitment to free and open-source software. Ubuntu is a commercial distribution, and it is backed by a company called Canonical.

Ubuntu version numbers derive from the year and month of release, so 18.04 was released in April 2018. Each release also has a code name, such as Bionic Beaver for 18.04 or Focal Fossa for 20.04.

Two versions of Ubuntu are released every year, one in April and one in October. The April release is a long-term support (LTS) release, which is supported for five years. The October release is supported for nine months.
