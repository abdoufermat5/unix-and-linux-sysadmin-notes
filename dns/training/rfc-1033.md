# Cloud providers and RFC 1033

**Scenario:**

You're hosting your website (`example.com`) on a cloud provider's load balancer, which has a dynamic IP address that can change over time. You want to point your apex domain (you root domain) to this load balancer.

**Traditional Approach (Doesn't Work):**

You can't simply create a CNAME record for the apex domain pointing to the load balancer's hostname (e.g., `lb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`). This violates RFC 1033, which prohibits CNAMEs at the apex.

**Cloud Provider Solutions:**

1. **ALIAS Record (AWS Route 53):**

   * In Route 53, you create an ALIAS record:

     ```
     Name:    example.com.
     Type:    ALIAS
     Alias:   lb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 
     ```

   * Externally: When a DNS resolver queries for `example.com`, it receives an A record pointing to the current IP address of the load balancer.

   * Internally: Route 53 manages the resolution by keeping the A record updated whenever the load balancer's IP changes.

2. **CNAME Flattening (Cloudflare):**

   * In Cloudflare, you create a CNAME record:

     ```
     Name:    example.com.
     Type:    CNAME
     Target:  lb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 
     ```

   * Externally: Cloudflare intercepts the query for `example.com`, resolves the CNAME to the load balancer's IP, and returns that A record to the resolver.

   * Internally: Cloudflare handles the CNAME resolution and keeps track of the load balancer's IP changes.

**Benefits:**

* **Compliance:** Both solutions comply with RFC 1033 by presenting A records to the outside world.
* **Ease of Use:** You can configure the apex record like a CNAME, but the provider handles the underlying A record management.
* **Dynamic Updates:** The provider automatically keeps the A record in sync with the actual target's IP address, ensuring your website remains accessible even if the IP changes.

**Key Point:** The external user never sees the CNAME record. They only receive the final, resolved A record pointing to the correct IP address, ensuring seamless access to your website.
