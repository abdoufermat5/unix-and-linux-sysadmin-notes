# Registrar and registry

**Think of it like a real estate transaction:**

* **Registry (The Land Owner):** The registry is the organization that owns and manages a particular Top-Level Domain (TLD), like `.com` or `.org`. They set the rules for that TLD, like pricing, eligibility requirements, and technical specifications.  Verisign, for instance, is the registry for the `.com` TLD.

* **Registrar (The Real Estate Agent):** The registrar is the company you go through to register your domain name (which includes the Second-Level Domain or SLD). They are accredited by ICANN to sell and manage domain names on behalf of the registry.  Think of companies like GoDaddy or Namecheap. 

* **Top-Level Domain (TLD - The Neighborhood):** The TLD is the extension at the end of your domain name, like `.com`, `.net`, or `.org`.  They are the broadest categories of domain names. 

* **Second-Level Domain (SLD - Your House):** The SLD is the unique part of your domain name that you choose. In `www.example.com`, "example" is the SLD.

**Analogy in action:**

Imagine you want to buy a house (your domain name) in a specific neighborhood (the TLD).  

1. You find a real estate agent (the registrar) who specializes in that neighborhood.
2. The real estate agent helps you find a suitable house (your SLD) within that neighborhood.
3. They work with the landowner (the registry) to complete the transaction, making you the official owner of that house within the neighborhood.

**Key differences:**

* **Registry:**
    - Owns and manages the TLD
    - Sets the rules and policies for the TLD
    - Maintains the database of all registered domain names within that TLD

* **Registrar:**
    - Accredited to sell and manage domain names
    - Provides services like domain registration, renewal, and DNS management
    - Interacts with the registry on your behalf

**Example:**

If you want to register `mywebsite.com`, you would go to a registrar like GoDaddy. They would check if `mywebsite` is available in the `.com` TLD, managed by the Verisign registry. If it's available, they would register it for you, working with Verisign to make it official.
