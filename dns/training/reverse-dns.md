# Reverse DNS Delegation Conversation

Realistic conversation between an ISP (Internet Service Provider) representative and a root DNS server administrator regarding delegation for reverse DNS.

---

### ISP Representative: John
### Root DNS Server Administrator: Alice

**John (ISP Representative):** Hi Alice, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm John from ExampleNet ISP, and we need to set up reverse DNS delegation for a new block of IP addresses we've been assigned.

**Alice (Root DNS Server Admin):** Hi John, no problem at all. I'd be happy to help. Could you provide the details of the IP address block that needs the reverse DNS delegation?

**John:** Sure, we've been allocated the `192.168.1.0/24` block, and we need to ensure that reverse DNS lookups for this range are directed to our DNS servers.

**Alice:** Got it. Just to confirm, you're looking to delegate the `1.168.192.in-addr.arpa` zone to your DNS servers. Is that correct?

**John:** Yes, that's correct. We have two DNS servers that will be authoritative for this reverse DNS zone. Their names are `ns1.examplenet.com` and `ns2.examplenet.com`.

**Alice:** Great. Could you provide the IP addresses of these name servers for verification?

**John:** Sure. The IP address for `ns1.examplenet.com` is `203.0.113.1` and for `ns2.examplenet.com` is `203.0.113.2`.

**Alice:** Thank you. I will need to update the root DNS servers and the relevant RIR (Regional Internet Registry) to delegate this zone to your DNS servers. I will create the NS records for `1.168.192.in-addr.arpa` pointing to `ns1.examplenet.com` and `ns2.examplenet.com`.

**John:** That sounds perfect. Is there anything else you need from me to complete this delegation?

**Alice:** Just to make sure everything is in order, please ensure that your DNS servers are configured correctly to serve the `1.168.192.in-addr.arpa` zone. Once the delegation is done, queries for reverse lookups in this range will be directed to your servers.

**John:** Absolutely, our DNS team has already set up the zone file. Here’s a quick overview of our zone file for verification:

```plaintext
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA ns1.examplenet.com. admin.examplenet.com. (
    2024060101 ; Serial
    3600       ; Refresh
    1800       ; Retry
    1209600    ; Expire
    86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@ IN NS ns1.examplenet.com.
@ IN NS ns2.examplenet.com.

100 IN PTR host1.examplenet.com.
101 IN PTR host2.examplenet.com.
```

**Alice:** That looks good. I’ll proceed with the updates to the root DNS servers and notify the RIR to update their records. This process might take a little while for full propagation, but you should start seeing the effects soon.

**John:** Thanks, Alice. I appreciate your help. Is there a way for us to check the status of the delegation?

**Alice:** Yes, you can use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to verify the delegation and PTR records. For example, you can run:
```sh
dig -x 192.168.1.100
```
This will help you verify that the reverse DNS queries are correctly resolving.

**John:** Perfect. We'll monitor that and make sure everything is working as expected. Thanks again for your assistance!

**Alice:** You’re welcome, John. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!
